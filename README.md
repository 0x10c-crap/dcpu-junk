# DCPU-Junk

I figured that someone might find it useful if I put my test programs on GitHub. This
is just a bunch of random junk I use to test various things, including assemblers,
emulators - literally just a bunch of junk. Fair warning, the version of organic and
tomato provided in here might be grossly out of date.

All of this is released into the public domain.
